TASK 2
+There are 3 variables of type int x = 5, y = 10, and z = 15; 
+Perform and calculate the result of the following operations for these parameters:
+x += y >> x++ * z; 
+z = ++x & y * 5; 
+y /= x + 5 | z; 
+z = x++ & y * 5; 
+x = y << x++ ^ z;

Plan
+create 3 variables;
+Assign new values ​​and display them
