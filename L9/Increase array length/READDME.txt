Elements of the array must retain their value and the order of the indices. 
Create a method that takes two arguments, the first argument is of type int [] array, the second argument is of type int value. 
In the body of the method, implement the ability to add the second argument of the method to the array by index - 0, 
while the length of the new array should increase by 1 element, 
and the elements of the resulting array as the first argument should be copied to the new array starting from index - 1.
