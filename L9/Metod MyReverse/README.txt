+TASK
+Using Visual Studio, create a project using the ConsoleApplication template. 
+Required: 1) Create a method MyReverse (int [] array), 
+which takes an array of integer elements as an argument and returns an inverted array (array elements in reverse order). 
+2) Create an int [] SubArray method (int [] array, int index, int count). 
+The method returns the part of the array received as an argument, starting from the position specified in the index argument, 
+with a dimension that corresponds to the value of the count argument.
+If the argument count contains a value greater than the number of elements that are included in the selectable part of the source array (from the specified index to the index of the last element), 
+then when forming a new array with dimension in count, fill in the units with those elements that were not copied from the original array 

+Plan
+create metod MyReverse
+Create metod SubArray
