TASK
Using Visual Studio, create a project using the ConsoleApplication template. 
Required: 1) Create a method MyReverse (int [] array), 
which takes an array of integer elements as an argument and returns an inverted array (array elements in reverse order). 
2) Create an int [] SubArray method (int [] array, int index, int count). 
The method returns the part of the array received as an argument, starting from the position specified in the index argument, 
with a dimension that corresponds to the value of the count argument.
If the argument count contains a value greater than the number of elements that are included in the selectable part of the source array (from the specified index to the index of the last element), 
then when forming a new array with dimension in count, fill in the units with those elements that were not copied from the original array 

Plan
create metod MyReverse
Create metod SubArray
