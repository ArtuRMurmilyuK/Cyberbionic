+Using Visual Studio, create a project using the Console Application template. 
+Imagine that you are implementing a program for a bank that helps you determine if a customer has paid off a loan or not. 
+Let's say the monthly payment amount should be 100 UAH. The client must make 7 payments, but can pay less often in large amounts. 
+That is, it can be two payments of 300 and 400 UAH. 
+Close all debt. 
+Create a method that takes the payment amount entered by the bank economist as an argument. 
+The method displays information on the status of the loan (amount of debt, amount of overpayment, message about lack of debt).
