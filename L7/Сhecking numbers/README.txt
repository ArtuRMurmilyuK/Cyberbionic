-TASK 
-Using Visual Studio, create a project using the ConsoleApplication template. 
-Write a method that will determine: 
-1) whether the entered number is positive or negative. 
-2) Is it simple (use the enumeration technique). 
-(A prime number is a natural number that is divisible by 1 and by itself. 
-To determine a prime or not, you must find all its integer divisors. 
-If there are more than 2 divisors, then it is not prime.) 
-3) Is it divisible by 2 5, 3, 6, 9 without a remainder.
