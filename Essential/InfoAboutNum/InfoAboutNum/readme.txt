Tas
Create class MyList <T>. 
Implement, in the simplest approximation, the possibility of using an instance of it similarly to an instance of the List <T> class. 
The minimum required interface for interacting with an instance should include a method to add an item, 
an indexer to get the value of an item at the specified index, 
and a read-only property to get the total number of items.
